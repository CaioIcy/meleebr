the successor to meleemajors.com

## analytics

- we use [umami](https://umami.is/) for basic analytics, like daily site views and how visitors interact with the website. while this could be useful improving the website, this is mostly because we want to know how much the website is getting used
- umami is a good choice for analytics, both because it has a free tier, and because it is relatively privacy-friendly (at least, according umami, for what that's worth)
